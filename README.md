🏗️ Model Architecture
YOLOv8 + U-Net Hybrid Approach
YOLOv8: Used for initial object detection and classification. It identifies regions of interest (ROIs) containing the waste materials, allowing the model to focus on these areas for precise segmentation.

U-Net: Applied to the detected regions to perform fine-grained segmentation, ensuring that every pixel is classified accurately (Bricks, Tiles, Concrete, or Background).

Post-processing: After segmentation, masks are processed to estimate the area and volume of each detected object in the scene.

📈 Performance Metrics
Accuracy: High segmentation accuracy with minimal over-segmentation, especially for complex backgrounds.

Inference Time: YOLOv8 + U-Net outperforms traditional methods in terms of speed, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Model Size: The hybrid YOLOv8 + U-Net model is lightweight, ensuring better mobile deployment capabilities.
